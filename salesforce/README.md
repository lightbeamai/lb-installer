### [Note](#note)
If the redirect URL configured in the Salesforce application is your organization's SSO URL, the code parameter will be sent to your SSO portal. To retrieve this code, quickly stop the browser immediately after opening the URL generated by the script to prevent an automatic redirect to authentication. In the developer console, you'll find a request containing the code parameter. Use this code in the script to obtain the refresh token.
